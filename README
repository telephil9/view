view
=====
`view` is an image viewer for 9front.
It uses the STB library to load PNG, JPG, GIF and BMP file formats.

`view` currently misses some features that are present in page(1) but
those will be added in due time.

Usage:
------
Install with `mk install`
Run with `view <image>`

That wouldn't be my code otherwise!
