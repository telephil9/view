view
=====
`view` is an image viewer for 9front.
It is a (almost) complete replacement for page(1) with some extra features.

`view` uses external libraries to load image formats:
- STB: PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, TGA, PPM and PGM
- nanosvg: SVG

`view` listens on the plumber(4) image port and handles both:
- filename plumbing
- image data plumbing when the plumb message action attribute is set to `showdata`

Usage:
------
Install with `mk install`
Run with `view <image>`
